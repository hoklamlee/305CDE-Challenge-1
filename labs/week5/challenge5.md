# 305CDE Challenge 5

There is no additional challenge this week.

Use what you have learned in Week 5 to improve your solution to the [Week 4 Challenge](https://gitlab.com/c0lin/305cde/blob/master/labs/week4/challenge4.md). The extended requirements ask you to implement the Wikipedia auto-suggest feature using JavaScript promises.
